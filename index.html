				GPS Navigation Project
				<div class="projectdesc">
					<p>An idea from one of the University of Pittsburgh's Computer Science professors for a capstone project. The idea was to programatically turn the GPS service On and Off during GPS navigation on a smartphone. Was on a team of 2 while using Agile methodology with 2 week sprints. Successfully created a prototype with only 1 week left to fully test. Initial results showed a potential 25% power savings. Project was picked up by another team after I graduated. Specifically for Android, not iOS.</p>
					<p>At the request of the University of Pittsburgh, the code must remain on a private repository. Also, to test functions and the UI, some location data and static routes were coded in, so there are privacy concerns as well about releasing the code.</p>

				Discord Bot
				<div class="projectdesc">
					<p>An interactable bot user for the voice chat service known as Discord. Contains some small functions like rolling a specified number of X sided dice, playing locally stored sound files on a voice call, also moving large groups people to different channels quickly. Primarily functionaility is to create event notifcations in which the bot user will issue a reminder notice in the chat to help organize events and remind people in case they forgot. Coded in python and uses the discord.py library.</p>
					<p>To add some personal interactions amongst various friends, I hardcoded some information like their usernames in certain places. Also, there is a string token that I use for the Bot account on discord, that if leaked would give someone else control. Either way, for privacy concerns this project is on a private repository. However, <a class="ordisdemolink">here are some demo GIFs</a> of some of the bot's functions</p>

				Mabi-Tools
				<div class="projectdesc">
					<p>A collection of tools I'm designing for the MMORPG Mabinogi. They do not directly interface with the game, instead they take user input and display data or visuals to help make decisions. Currently, only one tool is completed, a tool designed to help players with the game's commerce system.</p>
